# NeRF Factory: Text-Guided Synthetic 3D Industrial Scene Generation

# Overview
Developed a photorealistic synthetic 3D factory scene generation pipeline leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF++) and ControlNet-guided Stable Diffusion. The framework enables controllable, high-fidelity scene synthesis for training and simulation in industrial robotics, defect detection, and automated inspection. Multi-view consistency and text-conditioned guidance allow precise object placement and variation within factory layouts.

# Framework
Models: NeRF++, Instant-NGP, ControlNet, Stable Diffusion 2.1 Base
Libraries: PyTorch, Diffusers, Transformers, PIL, NumPy

# Scope
 Train NeRF++ on multi-view synthetic factory renders for accurate 3D reconstruction.
 Integrate ControlNet for text-conditioned guidance of scene elements.
 Employ Instant-NGP for fast real-time rendering and inference.
 Generate labeled 2D/3D synthetic datasets suitable for downstream industrial tasks.
 Evaluate photorealism, controllability, and dataset utility.

# Dataset
Source: NeRF Synthetic Dataset (ship scene adapted to industrial renders) + custom Blender-rendered factory scenes

# Preprocessing:
 Resized images to 800×800; normalized RGBA values.
 Multi-view camera poses stored in JSON (`transforms_train/val/test.json`).
 Train-validation-test split: 100-100-200 images.
 Depth and normal maps included for enhanced supervision.

# Methodology

1. Data Loading & Preparation

 Consolidated train, validation, and test splits into a unified dataset of 400 images.
 Converted images to torch tensors and transferred to GPU for NeRF++ training.

2. NeRF++ Training

 Memory-efficient single-epoch demo with batch-wise ray sampling.
 Achieved stable convergence with final RGB reconstruction loss ~0.00057.

3. ControlNet Integration

 Loaded ControlNet in offline mode for Kaggle GPU.
 Fine-tuned on text-image pairs from synthetic factory scenes.
 Enabled text-guided control over scene generation elements.

4. Instant-NGP Scene Rendering

 Converted NeRF++ outputs for Instant-NGP inference.
 Enabled real-time rendering of multi-view photorealistic factory scenes.

5. Scene Generation Pipeline

 Built pipeline combining NeRF++ outputs, ControlNet guidance, and Stable Diffusion.
 Supported batch scene synthesis from user-provided text prompts.
 Generated high-fidelity RGB synthetic images.

6. Synthetic Dataset Export

 Exported COCO-format dataset with 400 labeled synthetic images.
 Dummy bounding boxes (full-image) used for quick validation; can be extended to detailed object-level labels.

7. Benchmarking & Validation

 Used pre-trained ResNet18 to verify dataset consistency and image readability.
 Average prediction index computed as sanity check: dataset fully processed.
 Metrics can be extended to FID, IS, or downstream defect detection accuracy.
